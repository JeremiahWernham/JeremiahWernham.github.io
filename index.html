			            <p>Web Development is the work involved in developing sites for the internet using various tools, ranging from a simple website to a complex web application. Modern web development is both a set of tools and a way of thinking.</p>
						<h3>Outlook</h3>  
						<p>The web development toolset has been evolving for more than a decade. Mobile was the catalyst for significant change, and has helped get us to a world that is modular, lightweight, and highly flexible. Heavyweight frameworks like AngularJS paved the way, but it appears an alternative has found real purchase with the wider development community.</p>
                        <p>Of course, it won’t always be this way. And although React has dominated developer mindshare for a good three years or so (quite a while in the engineering world), something will certainly replace it at some point. But however the tool chain evolves, the basic idea that we build better applications and websites when we break things apart will likely stick.</p>
                        <p>Complexity won’t decrease. Even if writing code gets easier, understanding how component parts of an application fit together – from front end elements to API integration – will become crucial. Even if it starts to bend your mind, and pose new problems you hadn’t even thought of, it’s clear that things are going to remain interesting as far as web development in the future is concerned.</p>
